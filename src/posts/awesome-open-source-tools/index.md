I'm a huge fan of all things open-source. I've spent many hours exploring open-source software, and I've discovered so many fantastic tools and apps that have improved my workflows in so many ways. I want to share my personal favorites with this blog post.
These are the open-source gems that I believe deserve a spot on everyone's computer. I hope you'll enjoy them as much as I do! Let's get started!
