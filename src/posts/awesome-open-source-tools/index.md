I'm a huge fan of all things open-source. I've spent many hours exploring open-source software, and I've discovered so many fantastic tools and apps that have improved my workflows in so many ways. I want to share my personal favorites with this blog post.
These are the open-source gems that I believe deserve a spot on everyone's computer. I hope you'll enjoy them as much as I do! Let's get started!

## Design & Prototyping

For the few times that I need to design something or prototype something visually, I found that using open-source tools helps me in saving costs for subscriptions or software itself.

### Penpot

One of the open-source tools I've fallen in love with is [Penpot](https://github.com/penpot/penpot), a fantastic web-based design and prototyping tool that's perfect for UI and UX designers. It's a real game-changer for those of us who want an alternative to popular subscription-based design tools like Sketch and Figma.

The thing I adore about Penpot is that it's not just powerful, but also user-friendly and incredibly versatile. You can design beautiful interfaces, create interactive prototypes, and even collaborate with your team in real-time - all from within your web browser! Plus, it supports all major vector and raster file formats, so you won't have to worry about compatibility issues.

Another fantastic aspect of Penpot is the active and supportive community behind it. They're always working on improvements and adding new features, making sure we have the best possible experience.

If you're a designer looking to dip your toes into the open-source world or just searching for a budget-friendly design tool, Penpot is definitely one to check out! Trust me, you won't be disappointed!

### Excalidraw

I've been loving Excalidraw lately, a fun and easy-to-use open-source whiteboard app that's perfect for brainstorming and sketching ideas. With its minimalistic interface, you can quickly create hand-drawn-like shapes, lines, and text, making your ideas come to life in no time.

Despite its simplicity, Excalidraw offers powerful features, like real-time collaboration and easy sharing in various formats. Its open-source nature and supportive community ensure continuous improvements, making it an excellent choice for students, teachers, and professionals alike.

If you're after a fun, user-friendly, and effective tool for visualizing your thoughts, Excalidraw is definitely worth a try!
